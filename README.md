<body>Fennec foxes (*Vulpes zerda), the smallest fox species, are nocturnal desert dwellers in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, famous for their enormous ears that dissipate heat and pinpoint prey underground, while their pale fur, thick coat, and furry paws provide camouflage and protection from extreme desert temperatures, allowing them to survive with little water by getting moisture from food.
